// Assume createPost and deletePost are asynchronous operations, for example:
async function createPost(postContent) {
  // Simulated delay to mimic database write operation
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  return postContent; // In a real scenario, you would return the created post object
}

async function deletePost(posts) {
  // Simulated delay to mimic database delete operation
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  return posts.slice(0, posts.length - 1); // Returns all posts except the last
}
